<p> Maybe Christmas doesnt come from a store
    Maybe Christmas perhaps means a little bit more
<p>The first book I read by Dr.Suess was "Oh the Places you'll go.Oh the Places you'll go.Oh the Places you'll go.Oh the Places you'll go.Oh the Places you'll go.Oh the Places you'll go" 
<P> This was perhaps the best book I've ever read. Those pages with those pictures, those words - truer than ever before. This one book is meant for just anyone.
