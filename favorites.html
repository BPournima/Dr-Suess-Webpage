<p id="book1"> Its a warm warm Christmas story. With a little tear of happiness trickling down my eye, the Grinch has become one of my favorite characters. A fun&thrilling reminder that everyone has goodness within to deserve a chance of forgiveness.</p>

<p id="book2"> The most honest short story I've ever read. Those words put together in a way that they'll find their place in your heart. A book that tells you both good and bad happen - to always find our way through it. But no matter what, today is your day - Go move mountains.</p>

<p id="book3"> The crux of this book is that anyone could do anything if they'd put their mind to it. A book with a brilliant story and moral.  </p>

<p id="book4">An optimistic approach - to be grateful for the good things, strong for the hard things and brave for the bad things.</p>

<p id="book5">God!!This book was out of the world. An uninvited cat who turns the house upside down while he's having all the fun with the kids.I cant imagine a parent walking into all that mess. An entertaining book with great animated illustrations and a brilliant ending.
I dont think my mother would believe the Cat in the hat story.*winks*  </p>
